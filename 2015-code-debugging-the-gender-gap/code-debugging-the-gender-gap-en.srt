different algorithms,

And then you code 
up those equations.

And then for all 
the shots in the movie,

105
00:04:46,218 --> 00:04:47,385
the code crunches the numbers

106
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:50,489
and takes into account 
things like wind, and gravity,

00:04:50,522 --> 00:04:53,058
and whether Merida's climbing 
a mountain, or riding a horse,

111

sells her personality

There's this class and 
it's called Power Mechanics.

you take a lawnmower

the local hardware store

135

with the idea that at the end,

137

just not an equal part 
of history,

170
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:26,912
which is the case, of course,

171
00:07:26,945 --> 00:07:29,748
here in computer science 
and technology.

172
00:07:29,781 --> 00:07:31,216
Women were 
the pioneer programmers.

173
00:07:31,249 --> 00:07:32,751
They've been written 
out of history

174
00:07:32,784 --> 00:07:34,886
unfortunately in many cases,

175
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,388
but they were the ones 
who first understood

176
00:07:36,421 --> 00:07:38,990
that instructing the machine 
was more important

177
00:07:39,024 --> 00:07:41,126
than the hardware 
of the machine.

178
00:07:42,727 --> 00:07:44,896
One of the first women 
pioneers in computing

179
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:48,900
was Ada Lovelace, 
Lord Byron's daughter.

180
00:07:48,934 --> 00:07:52,370
(Nathan Ensmenger) 
She's often considered to be 
the first computer programmer.

181
00:07:52,404 --> 00:07:54,339
Very often we trace 
the history of computing

182
00:07:54,372 --> 00:07:56,107
back to a guy named 
Charles Babbage,

183
00:07:56,141 --> 00:07:59,811
who, in England in the 1820s, 
built some machines

184
00:07:59,844 --> 00:08:04,983
that look like 
a modern computer.

185
00:08:05,016 --> 00:08:07,986
Ada Lovelace 
was a mathematician

186
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:10,855
who wrote a first 
and very important description

187
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:13,959
of Babbage's 
analytical engine.

188
00:08:17,095 --> 00:08:19,364
(Walter Isaacson) 
She really envisioned 
how punch cards,

189
00:08:19,397 --> 00:08:21,366
which instructed 
the mechanical looms

190
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:23,969
that were driving 
industrial England,

191
00:08:24,002 --> 00:08:26,104
that they could be used by 
her friend Charles Babbage's

192
00:08:26,137 --> 00:08:28,840
difference 
and analytical engines

193
00:08:28,873 --> 00:08:30,942
so that they could do 
more than just numbers.

194
00:08:30,976 --> 00:08:32,077
They could be computers.

195
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:35,313
They could do words and pictures and music and patterns.

196
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:40,885
The first computers were built for special purposes:

197
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,921
breaking the German 
wartime codes,

198
00:08:42,954 --> 00:08:44,756
calculating 
a missile trajectory.

199
00:08:44,789 --> 00:08:47,425
And if you wanted to reprogram 
them to do another problem,

200
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:50,829
you had to unplug some cables 
and do some switches.

201
00:08:50,862 --> 00:08:52,864
And the women were in charge of doing the plugging

202
00:08:52,897 --> 00:08:54,332
and unplugging of the cables.

203
00:08:54,366 --> 00:08:57,035
They'd look at the diagram of the computer and figure out,

204
00:08:57,068 --> 00:09:00,338
"How would we move 
the cables to reprogram it?"

205
00:09:00,372 --> 00:09:02,407
It did not seem like 
the most important work,

206
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,144
but it took a good 
mathematical mind.

207
00:09:06,177 --> 00:09:09,314
(Nathan Ensmenger) The designers thought that this would be an easy job,

208
00:09:09,347 --> 00:09:11,216
that the building 
of the machine

209
00:09:11,249 --> 00:09:13,018
would be 
the most difficult task.

210
00:09:13,051 --> 00:09:14,352
And then you 
would have a scientist

211
00:09:14,386 --> 00:09:15,920
who would define the problem

212
00:09:15,954 --> 00:09:18,123
and these women 
would just be coding it.

213
00:09:18,156 --> 00:09:20,358
They'd be translating it 
from human language

214
00:09:20,392 --> 00:09:23,728
into machine language.

215
00:09:23,762 --> 00:09:26,798
It turns out that coding 
was quite difficult.

216
00:09:26,831 --> 00:09:28,767
And so, these women played 
a very active role

217
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,904
in defining what 
a computer could do.

218
00:09:32,937 --> 00:09:34,906
They had this equipment 
and somebody had to figure out

219
00:09:34,939 --> 00:09:36,241
what to do with it.

220
00:09:36,274 --> 00:09:38,476
Well, that's always 
a good job to give to the women.

225
00:09:48,019 --> 00:09:50,388
Hardware would put stuff 
as much as they could with it

226

239

the lack of women,

240
00:10:40,171 --> 00:10:42,373
how bad the numbers were, how the numbers were declining.

241
00:10:42,407 --> 00:10:45,310
But nobody was talking about the actual numbers that they had

242

243

were helping with the numbers.

244
00:10:51,382 --> 00:10:53,318
And so, when I came back 
from the conference,

245
00:10:53,351 --> 00:10:56,821
I issued this call to action 
that people could count up

00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:45,089
You know, diversity of thought, diversity of perspective.

507
00:23:45,122 --> 00:23:46,991
(Hanna Clark) 
We need a balance.

508
00:23:47,024 --> 00:23:48,626
Different people 
and different perspectives

509
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:50,728
are gonna bring a balance 
and they're gonna result

510
00:23:50,761 --> 00:23:52,897
in things being 
more well-rounded.

511
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:56,734
And otherwise, you may 
end up with one perspective

512
00:23:56,767 --> 00:24:00,704
and it's not going to be 
as beneficial to everybody.

513
00:24:12,716 --> 00:24:14,318
(female reporter) 
The U.S. transportation 
department announced

514
00:24:14,351 --> 00:24:16,020
new rules for airbags

515
00:24:16,053 --> 00:24:18,255
to eliminate deaths 
attributed to them.

516
00:24:18,289 --> 00:24:22,826
In about 160 cases, airbags 
have been blamed for death.

517
00:24:25,262 --> 00:24:27,264
(Ari Schlesinger) 
Unfortunately, 
the first round of airbags

518
00:24:27,298 --> 00:24:30,367
killed a lot 
of women and children,

519
00:24:30,401 --> 00:24:32,903
and it turns out 
that the airbags were developed

520
00:24:32,937 --> 00:24:36,040
for the average specs 
of the engineer on the team,

521
00:24:36,073 --> 00:24:39,276
and those engineers 
happened to all be white men.

522
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:43,414
And so, airbags were not 
developed with women in mind,

523
00:24:43,447 --> 00:24:47,918
and as a result, ended up 
killing a lot of people.

524
00:24:47,952 --> 00:24:52,089
And if you had had women on that team, you'd think that,

525
00:24:52,122 --> 00:24:55,726
"Hey, this airbag might kill me. I am not as tall as you are.

526
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:57,294
I don't weigh 
as much as you do.

527
00:24:57,328 --> 00:24:58,963
My frame is not the same,"

528
00:24:58,996 --> 00:25:01,165
that conversation 
would have happened.

529
00:25:03,434 --> 00:25:06,370
So, there's a long history 
across all sorts of fields

530
00:25:06,403 --> 00:25:11,942
that diversity is critically 
important if the innovations

531
00:25:11,976 --> 00:25:17,715
are going to positively 
impact all people.

532
00:25:17,748 --> 00:25:20,351
When the first voice recognition systems were designed,

533
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:22,386
it was by men.

534
00:25:22,419 --> 00:25:25,723
They were using 
male voices to test it.

535
00:25:25,756 --> 00:25:29,259
And what ended up happening is 
that women could not be heard.

536
00:25:29,293 --> 00:25:31,295
Not only could 
women's voices not be heard,

537
00:25:31,328 --> 00:25:33,764
but then when they were 
doing voice recognition

538
00:25:33,797 --> 00:25:37,968
and video tracking, 
women could not be seen.

539
00:25:39,737 --> 00:25:43,173
(Roz Ho) 
Back in the late '90s, 
we were putting a feature

540
00:25:43,207 --> 00:25:45,009
in all of the Office products--

541
00:25:45,042 --> 00:25:47,077
Word, Excel, Power Point--

542
00:25:47,111 --> 00:25:49,213
that's called 
the Office Assistant.

543
00:25:49,246 --> 00:25:52,149
And it's an animated character 
that pops up

544
00:25:52,182 --> 00:25:55,986
and gives you help 
on what you're doing.

545
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:58,322
We did a bunch 
of focus group testing

546
00:25:58,355 --> 00:26:01,825
and the results came back 
kind of negative.

547
00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:05,896
Most of the women thought 
the characters were too male.

548
00:26:05,929 --> 00:26:08,999
And that they were 
leering at them.

549
00:26:09,033 --> 00:26:10,734
So, we're sitting 
in a conference room.

550
00:26:10,768 --> 00:26:13,771
There's me and, I think, 
like 11 or 12 guys.

551
00:26:13,804 --> 00:26:15,973
And we're going through 
the results and they said,

552
00:26:16,006 --> 00:26:17,808
"I don't see it.

553
00:26:17,841 --> 00:26:19,877
I just don't know 
what they're talking about."

554
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:21,812
I said, "Guys, guys, look.

555
00:26:21,845 --> 00:26:23,847
"I'm a woman 
and I'm gonna tell you

556
00:26:23,881 --> 00:26:27,284
"these animated characters 
are male-looking.

557
00:26:27,317 --> 00:26:31,255
"And you went and spent 
$100,000 on a focus group.

558
00:26:31,288 --> 00:26:32,956
"You went and asked 
all these people,

559
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:36,427
and you're just going to discard all of this information?"

560
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:39,229
So, we ended up shipping 
with ten male characters

561
00:26:39,263 --> 00:26:41,932
and two female characters.

562
00:26:41,965 --> 00:26:44,902
And I just thought 
that was so instructive

563
00:26:44,935 --> 00:26:48,806
because they were ready 
to toss away data

564
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:51,809
because they couldn't 
see it for themselves.

565
00:26:52,276 --> 00:26:55,145
In computer science, 
an important mantra is,

566
00:26:55,179 --> 00:26:56,880
"You are not your user."

567
00:26:56,914 --> 00:26:58,449
There's a narrative in this

568
00:26:58,482 --> 00:27:00,284
"Women in computer 
science" story

569
00:27:00,317 --> 00:27:02,920
which is saying men 
are gonna make mistakes

570
00:27:02,953 --> 00:27:05,122
if they're designing for women,

571
00:27:05,155 --> 00:27:08,292
and that we need women if women 
are gonna be using the tools.

572
00:27:08,325 --> 00:27:11,328
And I think that that 
is letting people off easy.

573
00:27:11,361 --> 00:27:13,063
Women aren't this magical sauce

574
00:27:13,097 --> 00:27:14,398
that we're gonna 
sprinkle on everybody

575
00:27:14,431 --> 00:27:16,467
and they're gonna 
think about their users.

576
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,969
Every developer, 
every person who's designing,

577
00:27:19,002 --> 00:27:20,504
needs to be thinking 
about their users.

578
00:27:21,171 --> 00:27:23,240
To be a programmer, 
you have to do two things.

579
00:27:23,273 --> 00:27:26,110
You have to be able to think 
logically, in an algorithm.

580
00:27:26,143 --> 00:27:27,511
Step one, step two, step three.

581
00:27:27,544 --> 00:27:29,847
Either/or, and/or.

582
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:33,851
But you also have to be able 
to translate real world problems

583
00:27:33,884 --> 00:27:37,121
into a machine's language 
so you can say,

584
00:27:37,154 --> 00:27:39,056
"Here's what 
we're trying to solve

585
00:27:39,089 --> 00:27:40,991
and here are the steps 
to do it."

586
00:27:45,429 --> 00:27:48,098
(male instructor) 
The electromechanical 
differential analyzer

587
00:27:48,132 --> 00:27:51,268
performs scientific 
and industrial marvels.

588
00:27:51,301 --> 00:27:54,338
(Helen Bradley) 
Grace Hopper was the first 
person who came up with

589
00:27:54,371 --> 00:27:57,975
the concept of real programming languages and compilers.

590
00:27:58,008 --> 00:27:59,309
And what she enabled

591
00:27:59,343 --> 00:28:01,879
was computers 
to be used in business,

592
00:28:01,912 --> 00:28:04,848
'cause now you could write 
more complex programs.

593
00:28:07,117 --> 00:28:09,253
(male news anchor) 
Captain Hopper 
is a wiz at mathematics,

594
00:28:09,286 --> 00:28:11,088
some would say a genius,

595
00:28:11,121 --> 00:28:13,624
one of that small band 
of brothers and sisters

596
00:28:13,657 --> 00:28:15,893
who ushered in 
the computer revolution.

597
00:28:15,926 --> 00:28:19,563
And as far as we've progressed since this vacuum-tubed monster,

598
00:28:19,596 --> 00:28:23,467
Captain Hopper says, 
"We ain't seen nothin' yet."

599
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,170
You talk a lot about 
the computer revolution.

600
00:28:26,203 --> 00:28:28,906
I thought, 
we're in it and it's over.

601
00:28:28,939 --> 00:28:30,240
No, we're only 
at the beginning.

602
00:28:30,274 --> 00:28:31,575
We've been through 
the preliminaries.

603
00:28:31,608 --> 00:28:33,110
(news anchor) 
Well what's it gonna be like?

604
00:28:33,143 --> 00:28:35,179
We've got the Model-T.

605
00:28:36,013 --> 00:28:38,148
Grace Hopper had 
a piss-and-vinegar personality.

606
00:28:38,182 --> 00:28:39,883
She was like 
a great Navy person.

607
00:28:39,917 --> 00:28:41,418
She could curse 
with the best of 'em,

608
00:28:41,451 --> 00:28:46,156
and she ran that crew as if 
she were a Navy commander.

609
00:28:48,192 --> 00:28:50,928
She stays in the Navy 
the rest of her career.

610
00:28:50,961 --> 00:28:53,297
In fact, they keep 
extending her retirement

611
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:55,365
because she's writing 
programming languages

612
00:28:55,399 --> 00:28:58,035
for the Navy 
all the way through.

613
00:28:58,068 --> 00:29:01,104
People believe that she 
coined the term, "Bug,"

614
00:29:01,138 --> 00:29:05,042
because of a moth that 
was found in the vacuum tubes.

615
00:29:05,075 --> 00:29:06,376
So then, they kept saying

616
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:09,213
that they would have 
a bug in a system.

617
00:29:09,246 --> 00:29:11,415
(Nathan Ensmenger) 
She was working 
on one of her early machines

618
00:29:11,448 --> 00:29:13,083
and found this moth.

619
00:29:13,116 --> 00:29:15,385
And in her lab notebooks 
from this period,

620
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:18,589
we have this description 
of the very first computer bug

621
00:29:18,622 --> 00:29:23,193
and it's taped 
right into the notebook.

622
00:29:23,227 --> 00:29:24,428
And debugging, of course,

623
00:29:24,461 --> 00:29:26,697
is one of the things that's 
so hard about programming.

624
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:28,665
It never quite works 
the first time around

625
00:29:28,699 --> 00:29:31,401
and the context 
is always changing.

626
00:29:31,435 --> 00:29:34,204
And so, she's not 
just giving it a language,

627
00:29:34,238 --> 00:29:37,374
she's also really defining 
what is important

628
00:29:37,407 --> 00:29:39,142
and what's intellectually 
challenging

629
00:29:39,176 --> 00:29:40,644
and stimulating 
about programming.

630
00:29:42,312 --> 00:29:44,715
(male instructor) 
When the first electronic 
computer was planned,

631
00:29:44,748 --> 00:29:47,050
it was estimated that there 
could never be a market

632
00:29:47,084 --> 00:29:50,120
for more than 2 or 3.

633
00:29:50,153 --> 00:29:54,324
Today, there are more 
than 5,000 computers.

634
00:29:55,626 --> 00:29:58,195
(Nathan Ensmenger) 
In the 1950s 
and the early 1960s,

635
00:29:58,228 --> 00:30:00,530
most estimates 
suggest at least 30%

636
00:30:00,564 --> 00:30:03,400
and as many as 50% 
of all programmers

637
00:30:03,433 --> 00:30:06,436
in this period 
would have been women.

638
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:09,573
There's this wonderful article 
in the April 1967 issue

639
00:30:09,606 --> 00:30:11,475
of "Cosmopolitan Magazine."

640
00:30:11,508 --> 00:30:13,243
It's called 
"The Computer Girls,"

641
00:30:13,277 --> 00:30:16,980
and it's a description of the opportunities available to women

642
00:30:17,014 --> 00:30:19,249
in this computer industry.

643
00:30:19,283 --> 00:30:22,419
It's got quotes about style, 
and fashion, and dating,

644
00:30:22,452 --> 00:30:25,489
but it's this 
remarkably insightful piece

645
00:30:25,522 --> 00:30:28,759
on the fact that this is 
an industry open to women,

646
00:30:28,792 --> 00:30:32,062
that women 
are working in the industry,

647
00:30:32,095 --> 00:30:33,997
and that there are lots 
of opportunities for them

648
00:30:34,031 --> 00:30:36,333
to move forward.

649
00:30:37,234 --> 00:30:40,637
It's part of, I think, 
a confusing and conflicting

650
00:30:40,671 --> 00:30:44,374
set of messages 
that are beginning to emerge,

651
00:30:44,408 --> 00:30:47,511
however, about the role 
of women in computing.

652
00:30:47,544 --> 00:30:50,480
Companies like IBM are 
struggling to find programmers

653
00:30:50,514 --> 00:30:53,617
and they'll put an advertisement in the "New York Times"

654
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:58,021
and say, "Are you the man to 
control the electronic giant?"

655
00:30:58,055 --> 00:31:01,491
It's encouraging programmers, I think, to think about themselves

656
00:31:01,525 --> 00:31:05,696
as a special breed, 
somebody with the right stuff.

657
00:31:05,729 --> 00:31:08,465
Women aren't disappearing 
from computing,

658
00:31:08,498 --> 00:31:10,767
but the kinds of stories we tell

659
00:31:10,801 --> 00:31:13,337
about who belongs 
in this industry

660
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:16,039
are very much 
starting to be about men.

661
00:31:16,073 --> 00:31:18,742
If a girl has been told 
from the beginning that,

662
00:31:18,775 --> 00:31:21,812
"Oh, girls are good at art. 
Girls aren't good at science.

663
00:31:21,845 --> 00:31:25,716
Girls aren't good at math," 
then naturally this is just

664
00:31:25,749 --> 00:31:28,051
not a field they 
are going to concentrate on.

665
00:31:28,085 --> 00:31:31,488
And as they get older, they'll 
naturally start to fall behind.

666
00:31:31,521 --> 00:31:36,460
I think from a very young age 
girls and boys are kind of told

667
00:31:36,493 --> 00:31:38,295
what they're supposed to like.

668
00:31:38,328 --> 00:31:40,464
I've gone shopping in toy aisles

669
00:31:40,497 --> 00:31:43,333
and I'll see these pink 
and girly toys,

670

a lot of people in

00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:36,279
that the concept of getting 
girls interested in engineering

710
00:33:36,313 --> 00:33:38,315
and computer science 
was very niche,

711

Construction toys have 
been around for over 100 years,

really been kind of designed for

718

they're really educational,

And I remember the moment when 
I watched the Super Bowl ad.

737
00:34:53,356 --> 00:34:55,425
It just brought 
tears to my eyes,

738
00:34:55,458 --> 00:34:58,562
watching that kind 
of horde of little girls

739
00:34:58,595 --> 00:35:00,597
racing down the streets 
with their pink toys

740
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:02,532
and building a rocket ship.

741
00:35:02,566 --> 00:35:04,601
It was so incredibly empowering,

742
00:35:04,634 --> 00:35:08,772
particularly given the fact 
that typically in the Super Bowl

743
00:35:08,805 --> 00:35:12,542
you're seeing, you know, 
big boobs, and cars,

744
00:35:12,576 --> 00:35:16,613
and, you know, a lot of kind of 
typically sexist content.

745
00:35:16,646 --> 00:35:22,552
To see a girl empowerment ad, 
it was really disruptive.

746
00:35:25,889 --> 00:35:27,824
My mom was also 
a mathematician,

747
00:35:27,857 --> 00:35:29,993
and I grew up with the term 
"Stereotype threat"

748
00:35:30,026 --> 00:35:32,562
just, like, casually 
thrown around the household.

749
00:35:32,596 --> 00:35:34,497
But, like, there's some, like, 
pretty legitimate research

750
00:35:34,531 --> 00:35:36,833
showing that if you think you're 
gonna be less good at something,

751
00:35:36,866 --> 00:35:39,536
you'll start being 
less good at it.

752
00:35:39,569 --> 00:35:42,939
There are all kinds of forms 
of stereotype threat,

753
00:35:42,973 --> 00:35:44,674
'cause there's 
negative stereotypes

754
00:35:44,708 --> 00:35:46,943
about almost every 
single identity we have:

755
00:35:46,977 --> 00:35:49,579
our age, our race, 
our religion.

756
00:35:49,613 --> 00:35:52,515
But if you're, say, for example, 
a women trying to succeed

757
00:35:52,549 --> 00:35:58,054
in advanced computer science 
courses at an elite university,

758
00:35:58,088 --> 00:36:01,758
the prospect of being seen in 
terms of the negative stereotype

759
00:36:01,791 --> 00:36:05,462
about women's math ability 
can sort of knock you sideways.

760
00:36:05,495 --> 00:36:08,999
We got men and women who 
were very, very good at math,

761
00:36:09,032 --> 00:36:10,533
and we brought them 
into the laboratory

762
00:36:10,567 --> 00:36:12,969
and we gave them 
a very difficult math test

763
00:36:13,003 --> 00:36:15,839
that we knew 
would cause frustration.

764
00:36:15,872 --> 00:36:18,608
Our idea was that 
for these students,

765
00:36:18,642 --> 00:36:21,111
the situation would 
become different for men

766
00:36:21,144 --> 00:36:23,079
than it was for women.

767
00:36:23,113 --> 00:36:24,748
For men, they'd be 
frustrated and worried

768
00:36:24,781 --> 00:36:26,416
that they weren't 
performing as well

769
00:36:26,449 --> 00:36:28,018
as they might have 
anticipated.

770
00:36:28,051 --> 00:36:29,886
But for women, 
in addition to that,

771
00:36:29,919 --> 00:36:32,922
they might have worried that 
they may be confirming

772
00:36:32,956 --> 00:36:35,725
that alleged limitation 
in math ability

773
00:36:35,759 --> 00:36:39,462
that stereotypes in our society attribute to them.

774
00:36:39,496 --> 00:36:43,400
That extra worry would use up 
an extra amount of bandwidth

775
00:36:43,433 --> 00:36:46,736
as they fight with that, and 
resolve to push through that,

776
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:50,473
and to disprove that, 
and all the things that we do.

777
00:36:50,507 --> 00:36:52,575
But women performed 
a full standard deviation

778
00:36:52,609 --> 00:36:54,978
worse than men on a test,

779
00:36:55,011 --> 00:36:57,580
even though we had carefully 
matched the men and women

780
00:36:57,614 --> 00:37:00,984
for having the same skill level when they began.

781
00:37:01,017 --> 00:37:03,987
We do the experiment over again, 
but this time we tell them,

782
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:07,023
"Look, you may have heard that 
women don't do as well as men

783
00:37:07,057 --> 00:37:09,459
"on difficult standardized 
math tests,

784
00:37:09,492 --> 00:37:11,928
"but that's not true for 
the test you're taking today.

785
00:37:11,961 --> 00:37:14,464
"The test you're taking today, 
women always do as well as men.

786
00:37:14,497 --> 00:37:16,132
They always have, 
they always will."

787
00:37:16,166 --> 00:37:19,102
Under that simple instruction, 
women's math performance

788
00:37:19,135 --> 00:37:23,473
went up to match that 
of equally skilled men.

789
00:37:23,506 --> 00:37:25,742
Even though women 
may do well

in many of these

791
00:37:28,178 --> 00:37:32,115

have to be a genius

of person who belongs there,

00:37:43,626 --> 00:37:48,832

more strongly.

00:39:37,807 --> 00:39:39,776
who had already-- 
who obviously already

838
00:39:39,809 --> 00:39:41,277
knew what they were doing.

839
00:39:41,311 --> 00:39:44,714
(Yuni) 
Were you intimidated because 
it was all, like, mostly male,

840
00:39:44,747 --> 00:39:48,017
or were you intimidated because of the level that they were at?

841
00:39:48,051 --> 00:39:50,887
(Sammie) Well, it was mostly the level they were at, plus I was like--

842
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,256
I was, like, 
this 12-year-old little girl

843
00:39:53,289 --> 00:39:55,058
with all these older guys 
that had, like,

844
00:39:55,091 --> 00:39:58,027
no idea what I was doing.

845
00:39:58,061 --> 00:40:01,197
(Kiara) 
A lot of girls go into, 
like, college-level courses

846
00:40:01,231 --> 00:40:02,732
and they feel so behind.

847
00:40:02,765 --> 00:40:04,701
It's not that they're 
necessarily behind,

848
00:40:04,734 --> 00:40:06,169
it's just that they 
haven't been learning

849
00:40:06,202 --> 00:40:09,005
as long as some of the 
other students and boys.

850
00:40:09,038 --> 00:40:12,141
Also, like, computer scientists and software engineers,

851
00:40:12,175 --> 00:40:13,676
I think it's 
the most sought-after job

852
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:15,011
in the world right now.

853
00:40:15,044 --> 00:40:16,779
And especially, they're also looking for, like,

854
00:40:16,813 --> 00:40:20,984
female coders and things, and 
they're, like, so hard to find.

855
00:40:21,017 --> 00:40:23,686
(Isabella) So, when did you decide you wanted to create a website?

856
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,922
I've been thinking about 
doing this since I was about 11,

857
00:40:25,955 --> 00:40:30,727
but then I actually started 
doing this--it kind of, like--

858
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,196
I think it was at 
the start of 8th grade.

859
00:40:33,229 --> 00:40:34,364
How did you get the idea?

860
00:40:34,397 --> 00:40:37,267
Well, my dad, because I am 
in at his work all the time

861
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,835
and I see 
all these ninja coders.

862
00:40:38,868 --> 00:40:40,169
And they're so ninja.

863
00:40:40,203 --> 00:40:41,704
Inspired.

864
00:40:41,738 --> 00:40:43,039
Yeah, and they're not weird.

865
00:40:43,072 --> 00:40:44,741
Like, you can, like-- 
they'll talk to you.

866
00:40:44,774 --> 00:40:45,875
(Sammie) 
They're actual people?

867
00:40:45,909 --> 00:40:48,344
Yeah! And they, like, talk 
to you and I've had, like,

868
00:40:48,378 --> 00:40:49,946
some great conversations 
with some of them,

869
00:40:49,979 --> 00:40:51,281
like, totally normal.

870
00:40:51,314 --> 00:40:53,650
They're, like-- 
they don't all wear glasses.

871
00:40:53,683 --> 00:40:54,984
Like, they're totally normal.

872
00:40:55,018 --> 00:40:56,319
Not the stereotype.

873
00:40:56,352 --> 00:40:58,187
Yeah, and so I was like-- 
I was like,

874
00:40:58,221 --> 00:40:59,889
"Oh my God, 
these guys are so cool.

875
00:40:59,923 --> 00:41:01,224
I wanna be like them."

876
00:41:01,257 --> 00:41:02,759
And yeah, okay, 
they are mostly men.

877
00:41:02,792 --> 00:41:04,093
But I was like,

878
00:41:04,127 --> 00:41:06,296
"That's fine 'cause I can 
just be a queen ninja."

880
00:41:18,808 --> 00:41:22,045
I have a niece who 
was always great in math.

881
00:41:22,078 --> 00:41:25,148
Great in math all the way 
through elementary school,

882
00:41:25,181 --> 00:41:26,749
junior high school.

883
00:41:26,783 --> 00:41:28,251
And in high school, 
all of a sudden

884
00:41:28,284 --> 00:41:30,386
she's not good 
at math anymore.

885
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,855
And it's much more 
around the,

886
00:41:32,889 --> 00:41:35,825
"She doesn't want to be 
seen as being the smart girl."

887
00:41:35,858 --> 00:41:38,895
She doesn't-- 
it's all of those pressures.

888
00:41:38,928 --> 00:41:40,997
They want to be the cute girl, 
the popular girl,

889
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:42,231
not the nerdy girl.

890
00:41:42,265 --> 00:41:45,101
Oh, I never wanted to be the 
cute girl or the popular girl.

891
00:41:45,134 --> 00:41:46,936
A lot of girls 
do though, right?

892
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:48,404
I know.

893
00:41:48,438 --> 00:41:50,707
Girls start to associate 
math and science

894
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:52,775
as not being something 
they want to be

895
00:41:52,809 --> 00:41:54,110
associated being good at.

896
00:41:54,143 --> 00:41:55,979
They don't want to be 
thought bad at math,

897
00:41:56,012 --> 00:41:57,380
they just want to be average.

898
00:41:59,782 --> 00:42:02,852
Hey, I'm totally lost. 
Can you help me?

899
00:42:02,885 --> 00:42:04,721
(Cady voiceover) 
But I wasn't lost, 
I knew exactly

900
00:42:04,754 --> 00:42:06,055
what Ms. Norbury 
was talking about.

901
00:42:06,089 --> 00:42:08,825
It's a factorial, 
so you multiply each one by N.

902
00:42:08,858 --> 00:42:10,393
(Cady voiceover) 
Wrong.

903
00:42:10,426 --> 00:42:13,129
Is that the summation?

904
00:42:13,162 --> 00:42:14,964
Yeah, they're the same thing.

905
00:42:14,998 --> 00:42:17,000
(Cady voiceover) 
Wrong, he was so wrong.

906
00:42:17,033 --> 00:42:19,402
Thanks, I get it now.

[bell ringing]

908
00:42:22,138 --> 00:42:23,973
(Danielle Feinberg) In school, there's a big difference between

909
00:42:24,007 --> 00:42:25,708
what a woman is going through

910
00:42:25,742 --> 00:42:27,043
and what a man 
is going through.

911
00:42:27,076 --> 00:42:29,078
Now, it's hopefully 
changed a little bit,

912
00:42:29,112 --> 00:42:30,713
but when I was in college,

913
00:42:30,747 --> 00:42:33,716
there were 5% to 10% women 
in my classes,

914
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:35,451
especially my 
computer science classes.

915
00:42:35,485 --> 00:42:37,754
And what that meant 
was the guys

916
00:42:37,787 --> 00:42:39,489
actually all teamed up 
on the homework.

917
00:42:39,522 --> 00:42:42,025
We'd all be in the same room, 
they'd be working on it,

918
00:42:42,058 --> 00:42:43,259
figure out the little, 
sort of, tricks

919
00:42:43,292 --> 00:42:46,262
that were embedded in everything 
and share it with each other.

920
00:42:46,295 --> 00:42:49,499
And they wouldn't 
even talk to me.

921
00:42:49,532 --> 00:42:51,200
I mean, I couldn't 
really do anything else.

922
00:42:51,234 --> 00:42:53,369
I loved it so much, 
I wasn't gonna give it up.

923
00:42:53,403 --> 00:42:56,072
But there was definitely-- 
it was a pretty hard path.

924
00:42:56,239 --> 00:42:58,041
I went to MIT.

925
00:42:58,074 --> 00:43:02,145
There really weren't too many 
people in my class freshman year

926
00:43:02,178 --> 00:43:05,948
who were that interested 
in computers, boys or girls.

927
00:43:05,982 --> 00:43:07,483
So, it was kind of unusual

928
00:43:07,517 --> 00:43:10,153
to be taking the first 
computer class for anyone.

929
00:43:10,186 --> 00:43:14,824
That class probably had 
one girl in it, which was me.

930
00:43:14,857 --> 00:43:18,895
And the next class, oh, 
it increased a lot by then.

931
00:43:18,928 --> 00:43:21,397
We had two women in it.

932
00:43:21,431 --> 00:43:24,067
I was told by many professors

933
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:26,436
that I would never 
make it in industry

934
00:43:26,469 --> 00:43:30,139
and a woman should just as well go home and have babies.

935
00:43:30,173 --> 00:43:32,108
I was really wasting my time.

936
00:43:32,141 --> 00:43:34,110
I was lectured in a math class,

937
00:43:34,143 --> 00:43:36,813
singled out 
for having done my homework

938
00:43:36,846 --> 00:43:39,082
and lectured 
that women are inferior

939
00:43:39,115 --> 00:43:42,251
because they always 
do what they're told.

940
00:43:42,285 --> 00:43:45,188
That's not terribly pleasant 
when you're 18.

941
00:43:45,221 --> 00:43:50,393
I was not aware or focused 
on my gender in high school.

942
00:43:50,426 --> 00:43:52,261
The top performers in 
my math and science classroom

943
00:43:52,295 --> 00:43:53,830
in high school were women.

944
00:43:53,863 --> 00:43:55,431
It didn't feel strange there.

945
00:43:55,465 --> 00:43:57,567
But then when I went to college, 
all of a sudden

946
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:00,136
I was receiving these 
messages that it was strange

947
00:44:00,169 --> 00:44:02,939
that I was a woman 
interested in math and science,

948
00:44:02,972 --> 00:44:04,807
interested in computer science.

949
00:44:04,841 --> 00:44:07,543
"Colleen, you won't like 
majoring in computer science.

950
00:44:07,577 --> 00:44:09,078
"You won't like 
sitting in a basement

951
00:44:09,112 --> 00:44:11,347
coding until 
3 in the morning."

952
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:15,218
It seemed like every adult 
in my life between the ages--

953
00:44:15,251 --> 00:44:19,489
when I was the age 18 to 22, 
was telling me that same thing.

954
00:44:19,522 --> 00:44:21,491
And it wasn't until 
I was a senior in college

955
00:44:21,524 --> 00:44:23,526
where I found out that 
that wasn't something

956
00:44:23,559 --> 00:44:26,395
that my male colleagues 
were being told.

957
00:44:26,429 --> 00:44:29,432
There started to be an 
increase of the number of women

958
00:44:29,465 --> 00:44:31,434
who were studying 
computer science,

959
00:44:31,467 --> 00:44:36,205
and in the mid '80s 
it peaked around 40%.

960
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:39,575
And I thought when I entered 
college around that time

961
00:44:39,609 --> 00:44:42,378
that we were, you know, 
on our way to being 50/50,

962
00:44:42,411 --> 00:44:44,947
because it was, you know, 
steadily going up.

963
00:44:44,981 --> 00:44:48,885
It's odd that we could have 
gotten close to gender parity

964
00:44:48,918 --> 00:44:52,221
in people studying 
computer science in the '80s

965
00:44:52,255 --> 00:44:54,590
and then have it 
decline from there.

966
00:44:54,624 --> 00:44:59,362
It's when the idea of the 
nerd genius came to the fore,

967
00:44:59,395 --> 00:45:03,266
and that's exactly when 
women started declining

968
00:45:03,299 --> 00:45:05,067
in their representation.

969
00:45:05,101 --> 00:45:07,937
This whole image formed of,

970
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:13,042
"Do you have the right stuff 
to be a coder?

971
00:45:13,075 --> 00:45:16,279
A computer programmer? 
A computer geek?"

972
00:45:16,312 --> 00:45:18,948
And what this does 
is create this kind of culture

973
00:45:18,981 --> 00:45:22,385
of computing that today 
we know as computer hacking.

974
00:45:22,418 --> 00:45:25,521
In the '70s it was called--they 
were called the computer bums.

975
00:45:25,555 --> 00:45:29,258
They would hang around 
in these labs, and drink Coke,

976
00:45:29,292 --> 00:45:32,395
and eat lots of sugar, and 
stay up for days at a time.

977
00:45:37,066 --> 00:45:40,369
In the early 1980s, we start to get this new figure emerging

978
00:45:40,403 --> 00:45:42,405
in American popular culture,

979
00:45:42,438 --> 00:45:46,042
often called the computer hacker or the computer nerd.

980
00:45:46,075 --> 00:45:49,412
These are emerging 
out of incidents in which

981
00:45:49,445 --> 00:45:53,916
young male computer programmers break into other systems.

00:45:53,950 --> 00:45:55,618

00:45:59,155 --> 00:46:01,424
and they're wonderful stories.

985
00:46:01,457 --> 00:46:03,559
They're romantic stories, 
they're stories that embody

986
00:46:03,593 --> 00:46:06,262
a certain kind of 
frill and danger.

potentially being slightly 
anti-social or counter cultural

1003
00:46:43,466 --> 00:46:46,202
Pranking your friends, 
breaking into their system

1004
00:46:46,235 --> 00:46:51,340
is maybe an adolescent male way 
of showing your dominance.

1005
00:46:51,374 --> 00:46:53,476
The display of pornography,

1006
00:46:53,509 --> 00:46:58,080
later of video games in these 
labs that are closed places,

1007
00:46:58,114 --> 00:47:00,049
I think create both 
an environment

1008
00:47:00,082 --> 00:47:02,685
that is unfriendly 
for female students,

1009
00:47:02,718 --> 00:47:06,222
but also this idea 
that that's what hackers do.

1010
00:47:06,255 --> 00:47:08,691
So, if you're a start up firm 
and you want to signal

1011
00:47:08,724 --> 00:47:11,060
that you've got the right stuff,

1012
00:47:11,093 --> 00:47:12,662
you may not have 
a business plan,

1013
00:47:12,695 --> 00:47:14,363
you may not have a product,

1014
00:47:14,397 --> 00:47:16,365
but you've got 
a certain kind of culture.

1015
00:47:16,399 --> 00:47:19,135
And so this celebration 
of nerd culture in a sense

1016
00:47:19,168 --> 00:47:22,405
becomes a way 
of signaling your abilities.

1017
00:47:22,438 --> 00:47:24,140
When I started, 
the stereotypical programmer

1018
00:47:24,173 --> 00:47:30,546
was sort of, like, 
I was probably close to that,

1019
00:47:30,579 --> 00:47:35,651
which was kind of quiet, 
kind of shaggy looking.

1020
00:47:35,685 --> 00:47:37,219
What I've seen is that somebody

1021
00:47:37,253 --> 00:47:40,222
that really doesn't care 
about their appearance

1022
00:47:40,256 --> 00:47:43,559
and they just want to 
come in late and stay late,

1023
00:47:43,592 --> 00:47:45,494
and wear free t-shirts.

1024
00:47:45,528 --> 00:47:47,196
I think that's my stereotype.

1025
00:47:47,229 --> 00:47:51,767
Maybe more antisocial 
than usual.

1026
00:47:51,801 --> 00:47:54,737
Drinks a lot of 
caffeinated beverages.

1027
00:47:55,171 --> 00:47:57,473
Like at one point in my-- 
one of the jobs I had,

1028
00:47:57,506 --> 00:48:00,743
some guy actually thought I, 
you know, didn't have a home

1029
00:48:00,776 --> 00:48:02,445
and tried to--like, 
one of the sales guys

1030
00:48:02,478 --> 00:48:04,046
thought I needed money.

1031
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:06,182
That wasn't--that for 
sure was stereotypical,

1032
00:48:06,215 --> 00:48:08,250
but not, 
maybe not actually typical.

1033
00:48:08,284 --> 00:48:09,418
Probably not 
a brogrammer, right?

1034
00:48:09,452 --> 00:48:12,221
Like that's--I don't think 
that counts as a brogrammer.

1035
00:48:12,254 --> 00:48:13,556
- Brogrammer. 
- Brogrammer.

1036
00:48:13,589 --> 00:48:15,391
- Brogrammer. 
- Brogrammer. 
- Brogrammer.

1037
00:48:15,424 --> 00:48:17,626
What, in fact, is a brogrammer?

1038
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:19,195
Probably the traditional 
stereotype, right,

1039
00:48:19,228 --> 00:48:22,365
is someone who's socially 
awkward and, you know,

1040
00:48:22,398 --> 00:48:25,301
stays down in the basement, 
never sees the light of day.

1041
00:48:25,334 --> 00:48:27,336
Then you have the brogrammer 
who is, you know,

1042
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:33,676
kind of your frat style, 
kind of really Type A, macho.

1043
00:48:33,709 --> 00:48:37,813
I can teach you how you can 
go from programmer to brogrammer

1044
00:48:37,847 --> 00:48:40,783
in just ten easy steps.

1045
00:48:40,816 --> 00:48:43,319
Number ten: the workout.

1046
00:48:43,352 --> 00:48:45,321
There's a lot of cartoons 
on the Internet with guys,

1047
00:48:45,354 --> 00:48:47,523
you know, lifting weights, 
and wearing bandanas

1048
00:48:47,556 --> 00:48:51,560
and glasses, and sometimes 
looking a little pretentious.

1049
00:48:51,594 --> 00:48:53,763
I think the sort of phenomenon 
of the brogrammer

1050
00:48:53,796 --> 00:48:55,431
has really interested me,

1051
00:48:55,464 --> 00:48:56,766
because it definitely 
seems like initially

1052
00:48:56,799 --> 00:48:59,135
it wasn't necessarily 
that there were brogrammers.

1053
00:48:59,168 --> 00:49:02,104
A sort of combination 
of frat boy

1054
00:49:02,138 --> 00:49:06,208
and, like, intelligent geek 
that was super fun,

1055
00:49:06,242 --> 00:49:08,644
and they'd hang out, and party, 
and drink from the kegs

1056
00:49:08,677 --> 00:49:11,280
all of the time, 
and find the attractive women.

1057
00:49:11,313 --> 00:49:13,549
And, like, there's just sort of 
a heteronormative frat boy

1058
00:49:13,582 --> 00:49:15,117
kind of feel 
to the entire thing.

1059
00:49:15,151 --> 00:49:16,786
And I think it's interesting 
because I don't think

1060
00:49:16,819 --> 00:49:18,554
it really arose 
with them existing.

1061
00:49:18,587 --> 00:49:19,889
I think it arose as an attempt

1062
00:49:19,922 --> 00:49:22,258
to try to make 
computer science cool.

1063
00:49:22,858 --> 00:49:25,461
You need to completely 
change who you are, Richard.

1064
00:49:25,494 --> 00:49:28,464
A complete Teutonic shift 
has to happen.

1065
00:49:28,497 --> 00:49:31,434
- Tectonic. 
- What?

1066
00:49:31,467 --> 00:49:34,670
A Tectonic shift is the 
earth's crust moving around.

1067
00:49:34,703 --> 00:49:36,672
Teutonic, which is 
what you just said,

1068
00:49:36,705 --> 00:49:39,642
is an ancient Germanic tribe 
that fought the Romans.

1069
00:49:39,675 --> 00:49:41,343
Stop it.

1070
00:49:41,377 --> 00:49:43,612
You're being a complete 
tool right now.

1071
00:49:43,646 --> 00:49:46,482
I need you to be 
a complete asshole.

1072
00:49:46,515 --> 00:49:47,817
Do you understand 
the difference?

1073
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:49,819
If you're not an asshole, 
this company dies.

1074
00:49:49,852 --> 00:49:51,620
I think culturally 
in some places,

1075
00:49:51,654 --> 00:49:55,157
there's so many male programmers

1076
00:49:55,191 --> 00:49:57,259
that there becomes 
this sort of culture that,

1077
00:49:57,293 --> 00:49:59,428
sometimes for women 
it's really hard to get into.

1078
00:49:59,462 --> 00:50:00,763
And it's one thing if you think,

1079
00:50:00,796 --> 00:50:02,865
"Well, I just have to 
survive this class

1080
00:50:02,898 --> 00:50:04,733
"or I have to survive 
4 years in college

1081
00:50:04,767 --> 00:50:07,436
and it's gonna be better 
on the other side."

1082
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:09,205
But when you 
get to the other side

1083
00:50:09,238 --> 00:50:11,874
and you're suddenly in this 
place where you're gonna spend

1084
00:50:11,907 --> 00:50:14,543
8, or 10, or 12 hours,

1085
00:50:14,577 --> 00:50:16,612
and you're sort of 
being mistreated

1086
00:50:16,645 --> 00:50:18,647
by the people who are 
supposed to be your team,

1087
00:50:18,681 --> 00:50:20,182
I think that can be 
very difficult

1088
00:50:20,216 --> 00:50:22,418
to sort of work through.

1089
00:50:22,451 --> 00:50:23,919
Little things that, 
often times,

1090
00:50:23,953 --> 00:50:26,822
if I were to bring them up to 
somebody not in the situation,

1091
00:50:26,856 --> 00:50:28,557
they would say, 
"That was nothing.

1092
00:50:28,591 --> 00:50:30,259
Like, why can't you 
just brush it off?"

1093
00:50:30,292 --> 00:50:34,430
But when it happens every day or 
every week and it all adds up.

1094
00:50:34,463 --> 00:50:35,798
Off the cuff remarks about,

1095
00:50:35,831 --> 00:50:37,500
"Oh, maybe you should 
try being a recruiter,"

1096
00:50:37,533 --> 00:50:39,668
or "Maybe you should 
try being a product manager,"

1097
00:50:39,702 --> 00:50:41,203
or "Maybe you should 
try something else

1098
00:50:41,237 --> 00:50:42,538
"that's not exactly 
what you do

1099
00:50:42,571 --> 00:50:45,941
because maybe you don't 
look like what I expect."

1100
00:50:45,975 --> 00:50:48,310
The assumption is that I would 
not be a software engineer,

1101
00:50:48,344 --> 00:50:50,446
which is actually what I do, 
makes me feel like

1102
00:50:50,479 --> 00:50:51,881
I'm a little bit out of place,

1103
00:50:51,914 --> 00:50:53,582
or that they expect 
that I wouldn't be

1104
00:50:53,616 --> 00:50:55,284
a good software engineer.

1105
00:50:55,317 --> 00:50:56,785
I've been doing this 
for a long time

1106
00:50:56,819 --> 00:50:59,522
and so I'll walk into, 
let's say, a sales meeting

1107
00:50:59,555 --> 00:51:02,558
or a customer gathering 
somewhere,

1108
00:51:02,591 --> 00:51:05,427
and I'll be there as 
customers start to arrive.

1109
00:51:05,461 --> 00:51:07,730
I can always tell 
from body language

1110
00:51:07,763 --> 00:51:08,898
and from the way 
that people react

1111
00:51:08,931 --> 00:51:11,634
that when they get there 
and I greet them at the table

1112
00:51:11,667 --> 00:51:12,968
and greet them at the door

1113
00:51:13,002 --> 00:51:15,638
that they think that 
I'm just the cute girl

1114
00:51:15,671 --> 00:51:17,773
checking them in at the front.

1115
00:51:17,806 --> 00:51:20,342
And then when 
the program starts

1116
00:51:20,376 --> 00:51:21,577
and I'm the second 
or third speaker up,

1117
00:51:21,610 --> 00:51:24,013
and I get up there and I start 
talking about architectures

1118
00:51:24,046 --> 00:51:27,249
and I'm talking about software, 
it's so much fun.

1119
00:51:27,283 --> 00:51:30,419
It's one of the most fun moments 
that I have in those events

1120
00:51:30,452 --> 00:51:32,721
because all of a sudden 
people who are like,

1121
00:51:32,755 --> 00:51:36,759
"Oh what's she coming up to talk 
about?" start doing this...

1122
00:51:36,792 --> 00:51:39,495
You know? 
Like, "Wow!"

1123
00:51:39,528 --> 00:51:40,829
It's not being 
heard in a meeting

1124
00:51:40,863 --> 00:51:42,932
or having someone else 
repeat the same thing I've said.

1125
00:51:42,965 --> 00:51:45,935
I definitely have felt effects 
of people seeing my leadership

1126
00:51:45,968 --> 00:51:48,370
and seeing--and feeling 
uncomfortable with it.

1127
00:51:48,404 --> 00:51:49,939
I've been called 
"The Intimidator"

1128
00:51:49,972 --> 00:51:51,941
by male leadership 
at previous companies.

1129
00:51:51,974 --> 00:51:53,943
Even now, when I, like, work 
with, like, male programmers

1130
00:51:53,976 --> 00:51:55,644
and things like that, 
they'll often ask me,

1131
00:51:55,678 --> 00:51:57,346
like, "Oh, so you're 
teaching this whole thing,

1132
00:51:57,379 --> 00:51:58,914
but have you ever 
coded anything?"

1133
00:51:58,948 --> 00:52:01,283
Which to me is, like, kind of 
an odd question, right?

1134
00:52:01,317 --> 00:52:03,285
Like, well, how would 
I teach it if I hadn't?

1135
00:52:03,319 --> 00:52:04,620
But there's this 
assumption there, like,

1136
00:52:04,653 --> 00:52:05,955
that I brought the coffee.

1137
00:52:05,988 --> 00:52:08,290
One friend told me a story 
of her male coworkers

1138
00:52:08,324 --> 00:52:11,427
sharing pornography 
in the IRC channel

1139
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:12,761
where they were all working.

1140
00:52:12,795 --> 00:52:14,296
And when she 
confronted them about it,

1141
00:52:14,330 --> 00:52:16,465
they told her 
to stop being such a girl.

1142
00:52:16,498 --> 00:52:18,300
The tech world 
and the tech culture

1143
00:52:18,334 --> 00:52:20,469
will be so much 
better for everyone

1144
00:52:20,502 --> 00:52:22,438
when there are more women 
in the room.

1145
00:52:22,471 --> 00:52:28,644
The problem is it's hard to, 
like, with a good conscience,

1146
00:52:28,677 --> 00:52:30,879
encourage more women 
to come into an environment

1147
00:52:30,913 --> 00:52:34,583
that will, like, sexually 
harass them and not fund them.

1148
00:52:34,617 --> 00:52:37,620
(female reporter) 
What you're about to hear 
will likely offend you.

1149
00:52:37,653 --> 00:52:40,823
It's part of a presentation 
by Australian programmers

1150
00:52:40,856 --> 00:52:43,325
on stage at one of 
the tech world's largest

1151
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:45,761
and most 
influential conferences.

1152
00:52:45,794 --> 00:52:48,464
Again, you may 
find this offensive.

1153
00:52:48,497 --> 00:52:49,999
G'day, guys, 
we're from Sydney, Australia

1154
00:52:50,032 --> 00:52:51,967
and we're here to bring you--

1155
00:52:52,001 --> 00:52:54,370
- Titstare! 
- Titstare?

1156
00:52:54,403 --> 00:52:56,939
Titstare is an app where 
you take photos of yourself

1157
00:52:56,972 --> 00:52:58,474
staring at tits.

1158
00:52:58,507 --> 00:52:59,808
Why, Dave, why?

1159
00:52:59,842 --> 00:53:01,343
Well, I'll tell you, Jethro.

1160
00:53:01,377 --> 00:53:03,078
It's science my good friend. 
Science.

1161
00:53:03,112 --> 00:53:04,279
Science?

1162
00:53:04,313 --> 00:53:07,016
Did you know that looking 
at breasts is directly linked

1163
00:53:07,049 --> 00:53:08,917
with a good, healthy heart.

"Oh, women can't do this 
because men can do it better,"

1329

next generation and throughout.

1333

to have a new experience,

1335
01:01:59,648 --> 01:02:03,952

1336

in my family to decide

01:02:51,333 --> 01:02:53,235
for the purpose 
of a job, et cetera.

1352
01:02:53,268 --> 01:02:54,469
So, when I was growing up,

1353
01:02:54,502 --> 01:02:57,339

1354
01:02:57,372 --> 01:02:59,507
"Oh, you know, 
you could be a programmer."

1355
01:03:00,342 --> 01:03:01,943
As someone who 
studied rocket science,

1356
01:03:01,977 --> 01:03:03,945
I can tell you that coding 
is not rocket science.

1357
01:03:03,979 --> 01:03:07,616
But people can learn.

1358
01:03:07,649 --> 01:03:09,484

reserve the right to make

But the kinds of things that,

1361
01:03:12,988 --> 01:03:15,624
when our folks applied to 
our program, we asked them.

1362

"What is an app 
that you might make

in your community?"
